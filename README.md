Manage configuration depending on the current path

## What is relconf?

`relconf` generates TOML, YAML and JSON configuration files based on the current path. It reads its configuration from a
YAML file (see [Usage](#usage) for where that file is expected to be), merges configuration files based on the current
path, writes the final configuration to disk and optionally outputs an environment variable pointing to the generated
config.

This allows you to have different tool configurations automatically applied depending on which directory you're working
in - perfect for switching between different projects, clients, or environments.

## Install

You can download the correct version for your operating system and architecture using the `download.ps1` script. Don't
let the name fool you, the script works with Bash/ZSH on Linux or macOS too!

On Linux or macOS run:

```sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kfkonrad/relconf/main/download.ps1 | bash
# OR
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kfkonrad/relconf/main/download.ps1 | bash
```

On Windows run:

```pwsh
Invoke-Expression ((Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kfkonrad/relconf/main/download.ps1").Content)
```

If you don't like running scripts from the internet you can find and download the application in the
[releases section of this repo](https://github.com/kfkonrad/relconf/releases) as well.

You can also install from source using cargo:

```sh
cargo install relconf
```

## Usage

```sh
# generate configs for all tools
relconf
# generate configs only for listed tools
relconf -o foo,bar
```

## `relconf` in practice

Relconf will not run automatically. I recommend writing a wrapper around tools that use `relconf` to manage their
configuration like so and adding the wrapper to your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`/`config.fish`/`config.nu` (or similar).

- Bash/ZSH:

  ```sh
  # as an alias
  alias foo="source <(relconf -o foo); command foo"
  # or as a function
  function foo() {
    source <(relconf -o foo)
    command foo $@
  }
  ```

- Fish:

  ```sh
  function foo --wraps foo
    relconf -o foo | source
    command foo $argv
  end
  ```

- Nushell:

  Since Nushell doesn't support loading environment variables with `export` you'll have to provide a conversion function
  like `posix-exports-to-env` below.

  ```sh
  def --env posix-exports-to-env [] {
    each { |line|
      $line
      | str trim
      | parse 'export {key}="{value}"'
      | transpose -rd
    }
    | into record
    | load-env
  }

  def --wrapped --env foo [...rest] {
    relconf -o foo | posix-exports-to-env
    ^foo ...$rest
  }
  ```

Set up like this `relconf` will always run before the command `foo` gets executed, ensuring the configuration is
current and appropriate for whatever directory you're running `foo` in.

## `relconf`'s config file

`relconf` reads its configuration from disk. The following is an example configuration that uses all features.

```yaml
tools:
- name: jj
  inject:
    - env-name: JJ_CONFIG # optional
      path: ~/.config/jj/merged.toml
    - path: ~/.config/jj/other-location.toml
  configs:
    - path: ~/.config/jj/always.toml
    - command: erb ~/.config/jj/templated.toml.erb # path and command are mutually exclusive
    - path: ~/.config/jj/company.toml
      when: # optional, when absent the config will always be imported
        - directory: ~/workspace/company-gitlab
          match-subdirectories: true # optional, defaults to false
```

`relconf` preserves the order in which configs are listed and will merge and overwrite values in that order as well. You
can mix and match JSON, TOML and YAML files for both input and output and use commands that output JSON, TOML or YAML
(relconf will auto-detect the format).

If an injection has the `env-name` key set `relconf` will output something like this (based on the above config):

```sh
export JJ_CONFIG=/home/USERNAME/.config/jj/merged.toml
```

The output to stdout made by `relconf` is safe to `source` in Bash, ZSH (and other posix compatible shells) and Fish.
This makes it easy to automatically set the appropriate configuration variable like the snippets in the
[section above](#relconf-in-practice) do.

There's also a JSON Schema for the `relconf` config format available in
[assets/relconf.schema.json](assets/relconf.schema.json).

### Using templating to generate config files

`relconf` can optionally run arbitrary programs on any templated input config file to auto-generate the config. Your
specified command should print the config to stdout.

```yaml
tools:
- name: jj
  inject:
    - path: ~/.config/jj/always.toml
    - command: sh ~/.config/jj/foo.toml.sh # reminder: path and command are mutually exclusive
```

The following is an example of a simple template that will generate valid TOML when run with `sh`:

```sh
cat <<EOF
current-date = "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
EOF
```

### Config file location

The default location for the config file depends on your operating system.
See the table below for an overview. Note that only Linux, macOS and Windows are supported.

| OS      | Default config path                                                           |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linux   | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/relconf/config.yaml` or `$HOME/.config/relconf/config.yaml` |
| macOS   | `$HOME/Library/Application Support/relconf/config.yaml`                       |
| Windows | `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\relconf\config.yaml`                       |

You can override the default location by setting `RELCONF_CONFIG` or by using `relconf -c path/to/config.yaml`.

### Generating the schema

To generate the schema, `relconf` needs to be built with the `schema` feature enabled. You can enable the feature and
generate the schema like so:

```sh
cargo run -F schema -- --generate-schema
```

## Publishing `relconf`

See the documentation of
[kfkonrad/generator-standard-readme-rust](https://github.com/kfkonrad/generator-standard-readme-rust?tab=readme-ov-file#publishing-standard-readme)
on how publishing `relconf` works. Both repos use the same mechanism and scripts.
